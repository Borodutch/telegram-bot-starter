# Telegram bot template based on telegraf.js.org

Please, enjoy this starter template for Telegram bots based on telegraf.js.org. It includes most common middlewares used by me, MongoDB integration, language picker and internationalization and shows basic encapsulation techniques used by me.

# Installation and local launch

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/backmeupplz/telegraf-template`
2. Launch the [mongo database](https://www.mongodb.com/) locally
3. Create `.env` with the environment variables listed below
4. Run `yarn install` in the root folder
5. Run `yarn develop`

And you should be good to go! Feel free to fork and submit pull requests. Thanks!

# Environment variables

- `TOKEN` — Telegram bot token
- `MONGO`— URL of the mongo database

Also, please, consider looking at `.env.sample`.
